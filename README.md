# Laser-Defender

the base of this game is from this [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/). I added more to this game to put the game development skills I've learned into practice. 
The gameloop is defeating waves of enemies by shooting lasers while avoiding enemy lasers. 
The goal is to score as high as you can. 
The game has a save system that can store many save files that record highest score and longest survival time.

## How to Play
Download zip folder or clone the repo. The built game is in ```/Deployed/``` as ```'Laser Defender.exe'```. Run the file and enjoy the game!
