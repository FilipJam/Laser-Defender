# Laser-Defender

This is a game I made to put the game development skills I've learned into practice. 
The gameloop is defeating waves of enemies by shooting lasers while avoiding enemy lasers. 
The goal is to score as high as you can. 
The game has a save system that can store many save files that record highest score and longest survival time.
